# Privacy Policy for Domain Parser Extension

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Domain Parser is a browser extension that helps developers analyze network requests made by websites. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**Domain Parser does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

### What the extension does:
- Analyzes network requests made by websites you visit while DevTools is open
- Extracts domain names from HTTP/HTTPS requests
- Displays captured domains in the DevTools panel
- Allows you to export domains to a local TXT file

### What the extension does NOT do:
- Does NOT send any data to external servers
- Does NOT store any data persistently (all data is cleared when you close DevTools)
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT use cookies or any tracking mechanisms

## Data Storage

All captured domain data exists only in your browser's memory during the current DevTools session. When you close DevTools or the browser tab, all data is automatically cleared.

The only way data leaves your browser is when you explicitly click the "Export to TXT" button, which saves a file to your local computer.

## Permissions

This extension requires no special permissions. It only uses the DevTools API to observe network requests when DevTools is open.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party services, analytics, or external APIs.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
